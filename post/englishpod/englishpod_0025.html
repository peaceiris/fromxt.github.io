And it's come to my attention  that our company lacks any sort of   bird flu  c</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Basically, we need to come up with   a clear plan; we need to outline specific actions that our company can take to maintain critical business functions in case a pandemic  strikes.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>So, what I’d  like to do   is: first appoint someone to look after drafting our plan; Ralph, I’d like you to head up  this project.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>C:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Sure, no problem.

And I’ll think about the impact this will have  on our clients.  Hey, what about vaccines?  Should we be thinking about getting vaccines for our employees?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Exactly right.
