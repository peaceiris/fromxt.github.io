Yes! And yes! Jared of course I'll marry you! </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Oh Babe, I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you! I can't wait for all the adventures we're going to have, for all the fights and the laughter. I can't wait to grow old and wrinkly with you.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Oh Jared! I can't wait for our wedding! I hope you don't mind, but I've already chosen a date! Six months from now in the summer! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I've had plenty of time to start planning! </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>She what? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Oh don't worry sweetie, I didn't know when you were going to propose. It was still a nice surprise! As I was saying, I've got it all planned out. There's almost nothing left to do! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>four hundred? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>No need to sweat it My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be low-budget anyway. So roughly four hundred people, which means that the hall at Northwood Heights will be our reception venue. I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents' church and my uncle of course would be officiating. We'll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling. The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer. My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that. My cousin will be the official photographer. I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo. Did you know that she's going to be a professional opera singer? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Ah... </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we'll get the Youth Group to serve us. I was thinking that your friend's band could be our entertainment for the night. though they might have to tone it down a bit. Or we could hire a DJ. Your sister's husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings. what's their name again? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise- themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine. And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we'll make our toasts! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors? Who else am I missing? Oh, your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake! </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Wow. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>See? It's going to be wonderful! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>If I survive the next six months. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr></table><h1>Key Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">wrinkly</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">having a lot of wrinkles</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">propose</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">ask someone to marry you</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">rough</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">simple or that needs further changes, etc.</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">venue</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">the place where an event takes place</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">officiate</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">to perform the official duties of a ceremony</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">no-brainer</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">Something so simple as to require no thought</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">caterer</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">someone who provides food and service</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">decor</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">the way something is decorated</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">decor</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">the way something is decorated</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">florist</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">someone who grows and deals in flowers</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">favor</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">souvenir with a small gift in given to a guest at</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">toast</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">a celebrity who receives much acclaim and attention</span></td></tr></table><h1>Supplementary Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">unexpected</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">to be surprised by a given situation</td></tr><tr><td width="100">nervous</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">to have anxiety</td></tr><tr><td width="100">budget</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">to be financially observant</td></tr><tr><td width="100">overwhelmed</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">to have a excess of emotions</td></tr></table><br /><span style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="http://englishpod.com/lesson-redirect?v3id=0227">Online Review and Discussion</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&copy;2010 Praxis Language Ltd.</span></body></html>
