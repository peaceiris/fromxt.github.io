Are you up for some tennis today? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Mel:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Sorry, I can’t! I have to go to work,  pick up Jake and Maddie from school, and make them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Grace:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>You sound exhausted. Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities. She can also help you do some household chores, and run some errands. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Mel:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Oh, I don't know... it's hard to find the right nanny .You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids. I would love to have someone to help me out, though. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Grace:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>I think you should definitely consider it! This way you won’t have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you’ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings. I can refer you this great nanny Amy. She used to work for my neighbors, before they moved away. She’s very responsible, a good cook, and great with kids. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Mel:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Oh, that’s great. Thanks Grace. Can you give me her number? I’ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow. Maybe this way I won’t be so tired every day, and Dan and I might even get to go on a date once in a while .</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr></table><h1>Key Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">exhausted</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">very tired</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">hire</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">to give work</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">nanny</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">a woman who is paid to care for a young child</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">chore</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">a small job that is done regularly</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">errand</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">short journey that you take to do or get something</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">juggle</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">to do several things at the same time</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">refer</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">to send someone to a person or place for treatment</span></td></tr></table><h1>Supplementary Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">Babysitter</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">A person that looks after kids when their parents are not home</td></tr><tr><td width="100">Domestic Help</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">Any person that is hired to work at a residence</td></tr><tr><td width="100">Minimum Wage</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">The lowest legal wage a person can earn either hourly or monthly</td></tr><tr><td width="100">Maid</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">A woman that helps with the household chores such as cleaning and cooking</td></tr><tr><td width="100">Butler</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">A man that helps with the household chores such as cleaning and cooking</td></tr></table><br /><span style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="http://englishpod.com/lesson-redirect?v3id=0272">Online Review and Discussion</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&copy;2010 Praxis Language Ltd.</span></body></html>
