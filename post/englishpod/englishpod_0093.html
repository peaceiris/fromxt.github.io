My name is Rick Fields and I'm joined by the man with the plan,   Bob Copeland.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Thank you, Rick. We've got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams, Brazil and China, face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round. Without a doubt, both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>The ref signals the start of the game and here we go. Ribeiro serves and China quickly receives the ball.  Chen bumps it to the setter, and... a very nice set by Chen!</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Xu   spikes it! Wow, what a great hit! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but   he managed to get the ball in! Great play.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>It's China's service now. What a superb jump serve   by Li, oh, and we have a let serve. The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Brazil calls for a time out and we'll be right back, after a short commercial break.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table><h1>Key Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">encounter</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">meet for a game or battle</td></tr><tr><td width="100">ahead of (someone)</td><td width="100">Preposition</td><td width="100">in the future</td></tr><tr><td width="100">powerhouse</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">a highly energetic, strong team</td></tr><tr><td width="100">qualify</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">to reach the later stages of a selection process or contest by competing successfully in earlier rounds</td></tr><tr><td width="100">in top shape</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">in their best condition</td></tr><tr><td width="100">serve</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">hits the ball to start a set of the game</td></tr><tr><td width="100">bump</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">to pass (a volleyball) by redirecting it with the forearms</td></tr><tr><td width="100">set</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">the action of putting ball in the air so as to be driven to opponents' court</td></tr><tr><td width="100">spike</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">strongly hit the ball to opponents' court using the palm of the hand</td></tr><tr><td width="100">anticipate</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">to foresee and act in advance of</td></tr><tr><td width="100">jump serve</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">a serve with the ball firstly thrown overhead and then the player jumping to hit it</td></tr><tr><td width="100">let serve</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">the ball touches the net in a serve but still crosses into the opponents' court</td></tr><tr><td width="100">time out</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">a pause during a game</td></tr></table><h1>Supplementary Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">side out</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">when the team that served the ball loses the rally, causing the other team to serve the next point.</td></tr><tr><td width="100">whiff</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">a mishit â€” when a player attempts to hit (or spike) the ball with the open hand and nearly misses the ball</td></tr><tr><td width="100">dig</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">the ability to prevent the ball from touching one's court after a spike or attack, particularly a ball that is nearly touching the ground</td></tr><tr><td width="100">coin toss</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">is the practice of throwing a coin in the air to resolve a dispute between two parties</td></tr><tr><td width="100">draw</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">a contest or game ending in a tie</td></tr></table></body></html>
