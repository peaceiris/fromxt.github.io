My name is Rick Fields, and you guessed it, I am here with my main man, Bob Copeland.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Thank you, Rick! As you can see, ladies and gentleman, we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars!</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Whoa, that's a lot of cash! Let's go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>All right, were're here at the eighth hole.  It's a par four, and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid.  Although, I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole!</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Tiger Woods is about to tee off, and let's see if he has the same luck as Jack.  Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and, he seems to be very nervous.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Oh no! Not a good swing at all! It's definitely not his day today.  On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par.  He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees.  He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Oh no! A bear! Run, Tiger, run! Somebody call animal control!</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table><h1>Key Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">aficionado</td><td width="100">common noun, plural</td><td width="100">an enthusiastic admirer or follower; a fan.</td></tr><tr><td width="100">main man</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">my right hand man, my important helper</td></tr><tr><td width="100">cash</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">money in the form of bills or coins</td></tr><tr><td width="100">par</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">the number of strokes considered necessary to complete</td></tr><tr><td width="100">hazard</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">an obstacle, such as some water, found on a golf course</td></tr><tr><td width="100">hole in one</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">using only one shot to put the ball in the hole</td></tr><tr><td width="100">tee off</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">hit the ball for the first time on a hole</td></tr><tr><td width="100">caddie</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">person who carries the golf clubs and gives advice</td></tr><tr><td width="100">driver</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">the club you use to hit the ball long distances</td></tr><tr><td width="100">swing</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">the action of hitting the golf ball</td></tr><tr><td width="100">not (someone's) day</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">not a good day for that person</td></tr><tr><td width="100">bogey</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">score that is one higher than it should be in golf</td></tr><tr><td width="100">make par</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">get the score you should for a certain hole</td></tr><tr><td width="100">birdie</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">one point lower than the score you should get</td></tr><tr><td width="100">shot</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">the action of hitting the ball</td></tr><tr><td width="100">hard time</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">a difficult time doing something; difficulty</td></tr></table><h1>Supplementary Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">putt</td><td width="100">principle verb, present simple</td><td width="100">light golf stroke made on the putting green in an effort to place the ball into the hole.</td></tr><tr><td width="100">green</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">an area of short cut grass around the hole on a golf course</td></tr><tr><td width="100">break</td><td width="100">principle verb, present simple</td><td width="100">the action of a ball moving away from it's straight path</td></tr><tr><td width="100">sand trap</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">a hazard on a golf course consisting of a depression partly filled with sand.</td></tr><tr><td width="100">iron</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">golf a club with an angled metal head</td></tr></table></body></html>
