This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many, a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world. In Switzerland, a major avalanche was reported in the Alps. Fortunately, no one was injured.

In Chile, a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region. Losses are reported to be in the billions.
