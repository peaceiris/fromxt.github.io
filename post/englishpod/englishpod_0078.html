Let's get started. As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system. It is not enough to simply memorize our laws, it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed. This brings me to  our topic for today. Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Cinco de mayo?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>No, that's May fifth in Spanish, James, no wonder you are failing my Spanish class. No, May first is International Workers' Day.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Do we get a day off  from school then?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>No! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, but in other countries it is.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Aww, man!</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>In the nineteenth century, working   conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work ten, twelve, and fourteen hours a day. Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders, and by April 1886, 250,000  workers were involved in the May Day movement. Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price. On    May third, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many. A mass meeting was called for  the next day to protest the brutality.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>And then what happened?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Well, as we say, the rest is history...</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table><h1>Key Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">national holiday</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">The day that all people in a country will be on holiday</td></tr><tr><td width="100">comprehend</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">understand deeply</td></tr><tr><td width="100">settle down</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">relax, become calm</td></tr><tr><td width="100">aspect</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">part</td></tr><tr><td width="100">genesis</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">origin; beginning</td></tr><tr><td width="100">appalling</td><td width="100">Adjective</td><td width="100">terrible, horrible, shocking</td></tr><tr><td width="100">indifference</td><td width="100">common noun, non-variable</td><td width="100">showing no interest in</td></tr><tr><td width="100">hostility</td><td width="100">common noun, non-variable</td><td width="100">the attitude of treating something as enemy</td></tr><tr><td width="100">legislative</td><td width="100">Adjective</td><td width="100">relating to legal system</td></tr><tr><td width="100">drastic</td><td width="100">Adjective</td><td width="100">sudden and severe</td></tr><tr><td width="100">resolution</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">a formal document stating the wishes of a group</td></tr><tr><td width="100">constitute</td><td width="100">verb</td><td width="100">form, consist</td></tr><tr><td width="100">brutality</td><td width="100">common noun, non-variable</td><td width="100">violent treatment or behavior</td></tr><tr><td width="100">fire into</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">shoot guns into a place</td></tr></table><h1>Supplementary Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100"></td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">describing an event that is done to honor and remember a person or event in history/ in commemoration of</td></tr><tr><td width="100">proletariat</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">the lowest socioeconomic class; workers</td></tr><tr><td width="100">rally</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">a public meeting of a large group of people to support or oppose something</td></tr><tr><td width="100">proclamation</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">an offical statement made by a person who has power</td></tr><tr><td width="100">memorial</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">something like a statue, built to remember a person or event from history</td></tr></table></body></html>
