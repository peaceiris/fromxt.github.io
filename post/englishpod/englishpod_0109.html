You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Tim, you are too good for me.  You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy.  Oh, I could say that I'll be all you need, but that would be a lie.

I hope someday you can find some way to understand I'm only doing this for you.
