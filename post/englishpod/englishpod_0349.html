These past few days I've been living off painkillers. Man, I feel like my head is going to explode.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>You should get acupuncture treatment. My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>The results are too slow. On top of that, just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>They don't just randomly stick you, they find your pressure points. The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment, restoring the body's "chi".</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>But I get scared the moment I see a needle. How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>The needles are very thin, and as long as the doctor's technique is good, and the patient himself is relaxed, it won't hurt--on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain. Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin; they don't hurt at all. However, if you are really scared of acupuncture, scraping or cupping are also options.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Scraping is too terrifying. When they finish scrapping, your body is all red, as if you were just tortured. Cupping is the same, your body ends up with red circles all over it--looks like someone beat you up.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>This only signifies that the toxins have left the body. Actually, there is only discomfort during the treatment process. Once it's over you feel very comfortable.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Chinese medicine is strange. The patients are already ill, and then the doctor makes them suffer more.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>This is the only way to get at the problem. Anyway, if you want to relieve the pain,You are just going to have to be tough and do it.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Forget it. I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself. In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr></table><h1>Key Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">acupuncture</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">Chinese Medical practice or procedure that treats illness or provides local anesthesia by the insertion of needles at specified sites of the body.</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">pressure point</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">a point on the skin that is extremely sensitive to pressure because of the presence of pressure-sensing organs.</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">treatment</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">an act or manner of treating.</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">needle</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">a small, slender, rodlike instrument, usually of polished steel, with a sharp point at one end</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">cupping</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">the process of drawing blood from the body and the application of a cupping glass</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">flesh</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">the soft substance of a human or other animal body, consisting of muscle and fat.</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">painkiller</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">a drug, treatment, or anything else that relieves pain</span></td></tr></table><h1>Supplementary Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">meditation</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">devout religious contemplation or spiritual introspection.</td></tr><tr><td width="100">tai chi</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">a meditative exercise, characterized by  slow circular and stretching movements and positions of bodily balance.</td></tr><tr><td width="100">herb</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">a plant when valued for its medicinal properties</td></tr><tr><td width="100">incense</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">he perfume or smoke arising from  a substance when burned</td></tr></table><br /><span style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="http://englishpod.com/lesson-redirect?v3id=0349">Online Review and Discussion</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&copy;2011 Praxis Language Ltd.</span></body></html>
