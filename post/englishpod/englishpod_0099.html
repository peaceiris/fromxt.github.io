My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite  David Watson.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie " Lion King". Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film.  Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>I think otherwise.  Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality; it lacked heart.  And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Predictable!  How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie!  It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Well, that's just it.  It did have some very dramatic and  intense scenes  For example when Mufasa dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar.  Even so, the film is linear.  Mufasa dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliché.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>How can it be cliché? It's a fable!  It's telling a time-honoured story!  The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>You have always been so soft, Dave!</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Open your heart Dick. Don't shut us out.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Anyway... That's all for today folks! Join us next time as we talk about &quot;How to lose a guy in 10 days&quot; I'm sure you'll love that one Dave!</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table><h1>Key Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">dare to say</td><td width="100">phrase</td><td width="100">have the confidence to say</td></tr><tr><td width="100">rightfully</td><td width="100">General Adverb</td><td width="100">according to law</td></tr><tr><td width="100">erudite</td><td width="100">Adjective</td><td width="100">having a lot of knowladge; espically gained from studying</td></tr><tr><td width="100">impression</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">the feelings one has after a specific event</td></tr><tr><td width="100">depict</td><td width="100"></td><td width="100">describe, show, especially in art or pictures</td></tr><tr><td width="100">fable</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">beautiful story about animals that has a moral or lesson</td></tr><tr><td width="100">eternal</td><td width="100">Adjective</td><td width="100">lasting forever</td></tr><tr><td width="100">accusation</td><td width="100">common noun, plural</td><td width="100">action of caliming something is wrong</td></tr><tr><td width="100">plagiarism</td><td width="100">common noun, non-variable</td><td width="100">practice of copying others' ideas</td></tr><tr><td width="100">enchanting</td><td width="100">Adjective</td><td width="100">attractive, holding one's attention</td></tr><tr><td width="100">score</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">written work showing notes of music</td></tr><tr><td width="100">predictable</td><td width="100">Adjective</td><td width="100">easy for others to foresee what is going to happen</td></tr><tr><td width="100">portrayal</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">the act of showing or describing somehting, especially in art</td></tr><tr><td width="100">grim</td><td width="100">Adjective</td><td width="100">unpleasant</td></tr><tr><td width="100">linear</td><td width="100">Adjective</td><td width="100">moving in logical way, from start to end</td></tr><tr><td width="100">cliche</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">something that is too often used so that it loses meaning or importance</td></tr><tr><td width="100">time-honoured</td><td width="100">Adjective</td><td width="100">something that survives the testing of time</td></tr><tr><td width="100">soft</td><td width="100">Adjective</td><td width="100">not critical enough</td></tr></table><h1>Supplementary Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">screen play</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">the written words from a film</td></tr><tr><td width="100">performance</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">the activity of an actor in a play</td></tr><tr><td width="100">central character</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">the main person in a movie</td></tr><tr><td width="100">plot</td><td width="100">common noun, singular</td><td width="100">story in a movie or book</td></tr><tr><td width="100">cinematography</td><td width="100">common noun, non-variable</td><td width="100">used to describe the camera work in a movie</td></tr></table></body></html>
