Now of course, this represents an enormous challenge with enormous rewards for the winners, but for any new product we need a great marketing message and marketing campaign</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Ford:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>It needs to be directed and focused at our target consumer, and needs to be pitched at exactly the right level. The question we must first address is of course, who is our target consumer and secondly what do they expect from the next generation Alpha lap-top? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Ford:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Let's first of all tackle the first question. Our target consumer for the x420 is the middle class, white collar worker with an above average income. However, as we mentioned before the total number of computer owners is expanding rapidly and we need to broaden our audience for this product. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Ford:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>For example, the x420 is also ideally suited to the younger student sector, who might use laptops both for study and gaming. There is no doubt that. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Audience Member:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Mr. Ford, if I could just interrupt a moment. You say that the computer is suitable for students, but don't you think the price of the x420 is just too much for most students? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Mr Ford:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Well, that's a fair point. If you don't mind I'd like to tackle your question a little bit later in the Q and A section. Is that okay? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Audience Member:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Yes sure. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Mr Ford:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Okay, so as I was saying we have an exciting campaign planned for the x420. Firstly, we will have a nationwide television campaign, as well as advertising on radio and also in many computer publications. We also intend to. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Audience Member:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>I'm sorry to stop you Mr. Ford, but do you really think that a television campaign is cost effective. I mean, how much is that going to cost? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Mr Ford:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Well I don't have the figures to hand, but I'd be happy to discuss those figures with you after the presentation. Okay let me just go on to talk a little more about the exciting campaign we have in store. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></td></tr></table><h1>Key Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">untapped</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">available but not used</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">developing market</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">markets that are in growth</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">mature markets</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">developed market</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">marketing message</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">the information of the sale of a product</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">tackle</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">deal with something that is difficult</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">white collar</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">a person that works in an office</span></td></tr><tr><td width="100">Q and A</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300"><span style="font-style:italic;">question and answer</span></td></tr></table><h1>Supplementary Vocabulary</h1><table><tr><td width="100">consumerism</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">the increasing consumption of goods; a movement that emphasizes quality and consumer awareness</td></tr><tr><td width="100">bottom of pyramid</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">those people who earn around $1USD/day, the majority of the world's people belong to this consumer segment</td></tr><tr><td width="100">promote</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">to encourage, to advertise something</td></tr><tr><td width="100">out of reach</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">something that cannot be obtained</td></tr><tr><td width="100">wallet-friendly</td><td width="200"></td><td width="300">an inexpensive product; anything that saves you money</td></tr></table><br /><span style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="http://englishpod.com/lesson-redirect?v3id=0283">Online Review and Discussion</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&copy;2010 Praxis Language Ltd.</span></body></html>
