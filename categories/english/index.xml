A wide variety of sites offer text-only versions that work on any computer , but they’re occasionally buried and hard to find on the modern web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more than a few reasons to want to know where these sites are, however. Maybe you don’t like clutter? Maybe you’re one of the millions still using dial-up, and want a low-bandwidth way to read news? Maybe you regularly tether your computer to your smartphone, but don’t have an unlimited data plan? Maybe you like to read the news on your e-reader and want clean sites for doing so? Or maybe you want a list of quick-to-load news sources in case a disaster slows down your Internet connection just when you need it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever your reason, find a list of links to mobile news sites that work on any computer below, without the need for tricks like user agent switchers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
