To remove a ball, you must jump over it with another one. A valid move is to jump a peg over an adjacent peg into a hole two positions away and then to remove the jumped peg. Only vertical or horizontal movement is allowed in most board types. Diagonal movement is allowed only in the Triagular board. This may sound easy, but without a good strategy, you will get stuck sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>QR Code Generator</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/qr_code_generator/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2019 17:35:20 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/qr_code_generator/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I just use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/neocotic/qrious&#34;&gt;qrious.js&lt;/a&gt; to implement a simple QR code generator.Please feel free to try online QR code generator to make your own QR codes.

Researchers have discovered that meal timing strategies such as intermittent fasting or eating earlier in the daytime appear to help people lose weight by lowering appetite rather than burning more calories, according to a report.</description></item><item><title>Algorithms by Jeff Erickson</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/algorithms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2019 18:23:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/algorithms/</guid><description>Algorithms by Jeff Erickson

It began life as the so-called HTTP/0.9 protocol in 1991, and by 1999 had evolved to HTTP/1.1, which was standardised within the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). HTTP/1.1 was good enough for a long time but the ever changing needs of the Web called for a better suited protocol, and HTTP/2 emerged in 2015. More recently it was announced that the IETF is intending to deliver a new version - HTTP/3. To some people this is a surprise and has caused a bit of confusion. If you don&amp;rsquo;t track IETF work closely it might seem that HTTP/3 has come out of the blue. However, we can trace its origins through a lineage of experiments and evolution of Web protocols; specifically the QUIC transport protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Happy New Year Everyone!üíñ</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/hapy_new_year_2019/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/hapy_new_year_2019/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/canicula/ImgURL/happy-2019-year.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;avatar&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>IPSec Modes: Transport and Tunnel</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/ipsec_modes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/ipsec_modes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;IPSec modes are closely related to the function of the two core protocols, the Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). Both of these protocols provide protection by adding to a datagram a header (and possibly other fields) containing security information. The choice of mode does not affect the method by which each generates its header, but rather, changes what specific parts of the IP datagram are protected and how the headers are arranged to accomplish this. In essence, the mode really describes, not prescribes how AH or ESP do their thing. It is used as the basis for defining other constructs, such as security associations (SAs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs take a look at how the two modes work.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Collection of some useful websites</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/some_useful_webs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2018 21:03:37 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/some_useful_webs/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Here are the most useful websites on the Internet that will make you smarter, increase productivity and help you learn new skills.

Maybe you‚Äôre one of the millions still using dial-up, and want a low-bandwidth way to read news? Maybe you regularly tether your computer to your smartphone, but don‚Äôt have an unlimited data plan? Maybe you like to read the news on your e-reader and want clean sites for doing so?
