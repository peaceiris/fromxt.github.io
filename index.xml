Researchers have discovered that meal timing strategies such as intermittent fasting or eating earlier in the daytime appear to help people lose weight by lowering appetite rather than burning more calories, according to a report.</description></item><item><title>Algorithms by Jeff Erickson</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/algorithms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2019 18:23:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/algorithms/</guid><description>Algorithms by Jeff Erickson

It began life as the so-called HTTP/0.9 protocol in 1991, and by 1999 had evolved to HTTP/1.1, which was standardised within the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). HTTP/1.1 was good enough for a long time but the ever changing needs of the Web called for a better suited protocol, and HTTP/2 emerged in 2015. More recently it was announced that the IETF is intending to deliver a new version - HTTP/3. To some people this is a surprise and has caused a bit of confusion. If you don&amp;rsquo;t track IETF work closely it might seem that HTTP/3 has come out of the blue. However, we can trace its origins through a lineage of experiments and evolution of Web protocols; specifically the QUIC transport protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>IPSec Modes: Transport and Tunnel</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/ipsec_modes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/ipsec_modes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;IPSec modes are closely related to the function of the two core protocols, the Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). Both of these protocols provide protection by adding to a datagram a header (and possibly other fields) containing security information. The choice of mode does not affect the method by which each generates its header, but rather, changes what specific parts of the IP datagram are protected and how the headers are arranged to accomplish this. In essence, the mode really describes, not prescribes how AH or ESP do their thing. It is used as the basis for defining other constructs, such as security associations (SAs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at how the two modes work.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Collection of some useful websites</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/some_useful_webs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Nov 2018 21:03:37 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/some_useful_webs/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Here are the most useful websites on the Internet that will make you smarter, increase productivity and help you learn new skills.

&lt;p&gt;Google suddenly cuts characters from address bar for the sake of brevity (yeah right), confusing the heck out of us.The truncation is the result of Chrome programmers considering www to be a &amp;ldquo;trivial&amp;rdquo; subdomain, and setting it to be removed from the address bar.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Free Sites to Receive SMS Online</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/free_sms_receive/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/free_sms_receive/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Many web services nowadays require a phone verification system.

A wide variety of sites offer text-only versions that work on any computer , but they’re occasionally buried and hard to find on the modern web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more than a few reasons to want to know where these sites are, however. Maybe you don’t like clutter? Maybe you’re one of the millions still using dial-up, and want a low-bandwidth way to read news? Maybe you regularly tether your computer to your smartphone, but don’t have an unlimited data plan? Maybe you like to read the news on your e-reader and want clean sites for doing so? Or maybe you want a list of quick-to-load news sources in case a disaster slows down your Internet connection just when you need it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever your reason, find a list of links to mobile news sites that work on any computer below, without the need for tricks like user agent switchers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
